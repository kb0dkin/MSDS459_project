<h1> Guitar Recommender </h1>

<article> 
    Welcome to the Guitar Recommender, a final project for the 2023 Winter Quarter of MSDS 432.

    <br><br>
    This program contains records of thousands of guitars scraped from <a href="guitarcenter.com">Guitar Center,</a>
    an online store for guitars and other musical instruments. If we were to extend this project in the future, we would
    likely scrape from several more websites to expand our data even further.

    <br><br>
    This programs requires a local instance of <a href="EdgeDB">EdgeDB</a> to be running. For more information on that process,
    please view the ReadMe that is available in the base code directory or on the 
    <a href="github.com/kb0dkin/MSDS459_project">github repository</a>
